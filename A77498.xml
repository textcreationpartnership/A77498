         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>And after the ſame manner will he deal with all thoſe who have not a ſhare in that ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, even all wicked and ungodly men.

               <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> (ſaith the Originall) <hi>I am able for all things,</hi> viz. to ſuffer them. Such are the things which he there ſpeaketh of in the verſe fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going, rather <hi>paſſions</hi> then <hi>actions,</hi> as <hi>to be abaſed, to ſuffer want,</hi> &amp;c. theſe things <hi>Paul</hi> apprehends himſelf able to do. But what made him ſo ſtrong? Not any ſtrength of his own, but the power of ſupernaturall grace received from his Lord and Maſter Chriſt. <hi>Through Chriſt that ſtrengthneth me.</hi> And the like may every true Believer ſay, how weak ſoever of himſelf, yet through the grace of Chriſt ſtrengthning of him, he ſhall be able to bear, to ſuffer what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever God ſhall pleaſe to lay upon him. Thus it is not the ſtrength of <hi>Nature,</hi> but of <hi>Grace,</hi> which maketh them thus able. Even as it is with a <hi>Leaden Veſſel,</hi> which of it ſelf, being empty, is ſubject to melt with a little fire, but put water, or other liquor into it, and now it is able to indure the hotteſt Fornace; ſo it is with Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, of themſelves they are weak and feeble, their hearts are ready to <hi>melt</hi> within them upon
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:170444:20"/>ſome great tryall. As it is ſaid of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> when they were ſmitten at <hi>Aye,</hi> Joſh. 7.5. <hi>The hearts of the people melted, and became as water.</hi> And the like ſaith <hi>David</hi> of himſelf, Pſal. 119.28. <hi>My ſoul melted for heavineſſe.</hi> So is it ſometimes with the beſt and ſtrongeſt Chriſtians; being brought into a Fornace of affliction, ſome fiery tryall, their hearts are ready to melt within them. But being by grace ſtrengthned in the inward man, through this ſupernaturall ſtrength, they are made <hi>pares oneri,</hi> able to ſuffer that which all the ſtrength of Nature could not doe.</p>
            <p>And to this ſtrength it is,
<note place="margin">Afflictions proportioned to Gods ſtrength in his people.</note> that God propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioneth the ſufferings of his people: Not to their <hi>own</hi> ſtrength, but to <hi>his</hi> ſtrength. Not to the ſtrength of <hi>Nature,</hi> but to the ſtrength of <hi>Grace;</hi> that ſtrength which either already they have, or which he <hi>ſupplyeth</hi> to them. For ſo it is when God cometh to lay greater burdens upon his people then they are able to bear, now he cometh in with a new ſupply of ſtrength unto them. In this way it was that <hi>Paul</hi> was ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under that Temptation wherewith he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, by a ſupply of Grace. <hi>My grace is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for thee,</hi> 2 Cor. 12.9. The ſtronger conflicts any of Gods people meet with, the more Grace doth he confer upon them, for the inabling them to withſtand thoſe aſſaults. And thus is <hi>his power made perfect in weakneſſe</hi> (as it there fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth;) putting forth, and ſhewing it ſelf more in ſupporting his people under ſuch tryals, as in themſelves do far exceed their ſtrength. And thus you ſee this <hi>Doctrine</hi> confirmed and made good, how <hi>God</hi> diſpenſeth all afflictions to his people, by <hi>meaſure,</hi> and that a meaſure of <hi>mercy,</hi>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:170444:20"/>proportioning them to their <hi>ſtrength,</hi> that ſtrength of <hi>grace</hi> which they have, or which he giveth them.</p>
            <p>And will you know why he dealeth with them after this manner?

I will not make a full end of thee, but I will correct thee in meaſure.</hi> And ſuch uſe let all the <hi>Sons of Sion,</hi> all true <hi>Iſraelites</hi> make of it. However God may correct and puniſh them for their ſins, (which he will do as ſoon, or ſooner then any other, <hi>You only have I known of all the Families of the earth, therefore you will I puniſh for all your iniquities,</hi> (ſaith the Lord to <hi>Iſrael,</hi>) Amos 3.2.) <hi>I will not leave thee wholly unpuniſhed</hi> (ſaith the former Text,) yet here is the comfort; he will not puniſh them as he puniſheth others. <hi>Hath he ſmitten them as he ſmote thoſe that ſmote him?</hi> Iſa. 27.8. He will correct them in <hi>meaſure,</hi> with <hi>judgement,</hi> with a wiſe and mercifull moderation.</p>
            <p>Which let it ſerve to byace and bear up the hearts and ſpirits of the ſons and daughters of Affliction under whatever ſufferings.

            <p>And O that all the Lords people were but fully perſwaded of the truth hereof! that all their afflictions are thus diſpenced to them. How patient, how contented, how chearfull, how thankfull would it make them, under whatever ſuffering? What is the reaſon that the hearts of men are ſo ſubject to melt and faint under afflictions? Surely one chief cauſe of this <hi>deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quium,</hi> this ſoul-fainting is, <hi>unbelief.</hi> Men are
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:170444:21"/>not fully perſwaded that there is ſuch an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruling hand of Providence in the ordering and diſpoſing of them, that they are thus meaſured out for the breadth, the length, the greatneſs and the continuance of them; they look upon them as happening to them by chance or fortune. Which while they doe, no wonder if they ſink under their burden. But ſo let not Gods children look upon their ſufferings. Whatever they be let them look upon them under this notion, as their <hi>Cup,</hi> their <hi>portion</hi> meaſured out unto them;</p>
            <p>And that by a <hi>meaſure of mercy.</hi> There is the conſolation. The puniſhments of wicked men are meaſured out too, they alſo have their <hi>cup.</hi> But it is by a meaſure of <hi>juſtice,</hi> proportioning them to their ſins. But the ſufferings of Gods people are meaſured out by a meaſure of <hi>mercy,</hi> proportioned to their <hi>ſtrength.</hi> And what a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port may this be unto them, (if rightly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered) under whatever afflictions? Be they what they will, they ſhall not <hi>exceed their ſtrength,</hi> the ſtrength which they have, or that which God will ſupply unto them. For this the Apoſtle is bold to engage Gods Fidelity in that forecited Text, 1 Cor. 10.13. <hi>God is Faithfull, who will not ſuffer you to be tempted above what you are able.</hi> And what an incouragement is here? Of all diſcouragements there is none greater to a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian in his ſuffering condition, then the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of his own weakneſſe, want of ſtrength to undergoe what he feeleth or feareth. <hi>What is my ſtrength</hi> (ſaith <hi>Job) that I ſhould hope? Is my ſtrength the ſtrength of ſtones, or is my fleſh of broſſe?</hi> Job 6.11, 12. O (ſaith the poor ſoul) had I but ſtrength to bear my burden, were it never
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:170444:22"/>ſo heavy I ſhould be contented with it, but my burden is great, and my ſtrength little. How then ſhall I but <hi>faint in the day of adverſity?</hi> (as the wiſe man hath it, Prov. 24.10.) But let not this diſcourage any true Believer. Thou wanteſt ſtrength; alas, who doth not? When as ſuch a tall <hi>Cedar</hi> as that bleſſed <hi>Apoſtle</hi> was, ſhould be preſſed <hi>beyond ſtrength</hi> with the apprehenſion of an imminent danger, how ſhould ſuch <hi>Shrubs</hi> as thou and I ever look to hold up head, if we look at our own ſtrength? I, but remember to whoſe ſtrength it is that God proportioneth the ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of his children; it is not their ſtrength, but his own ſtrength. Chriſtians are much deceived when they look upon themſelves for ſtrength, either to do, or ſuffer any thing. No, this is a <hi>condition on Gods part,</hi> not ours.</p>
            <p>A comfortable meditation.
<note place="margin">Gods Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with his people to give them ſtrength, as to doe, ſo to ſuffer his will.</note> When God en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treth into Covenant with his people (the <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace,</hi>) they covenant with him to be willing to doe and to ſuffer what he ſhall require and impoſe, ſo to be at his ordering and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, both as to their <hi>active</hi> and <hi>paſſive</hi> obedience. This is the condition on their parts. But on the other part, God graciouſly covenanteth with them to give unto them <hi>ſtrength</hi> to doe what he commandeth. That is the condition on Gods part. As when he ſends <hi>Moſes</hi> upon that Embaſſage to <hi>Pharaoh, Moſes</hi> yields his ſervice, but God covenanteth with him to inable him for it. <hi>Certainly I will be with thee,</hi> Exod. 3.12. as to protect, ſo to direct and inable thee. So is it in <hi>Paſſive Obedience.</hi> So long as Gods people are willing to ſuffer what he ſhall impoſe, he will be with them. <hi>When thou paſſeſt through the waters
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:170444:22"/>I will be with thee,</hi> Iſai. 43.2. ſo is God with his people in all their ſufferings, ſupporting them under them as well as delivering them out of them. How then is it that Chriſtians in their ſufferings look ſo much at themſelves, their own ſtrength, as if this were a condition on their part? No, God hath ingaged himſelf for it, and he will make it good. Only ſee that we be <hi>willing to ſuffer.</hi> As for <hi>strength</hi> in ſuffering, leave that to that God, who will ſo order the affliction, that we ſhall be through his ſtrength able to bear it.</p>
            <p>And therefore trouble not our ſelves in this caſe,
<note place="margin">Chriſtians not to trouble themſelves with needleſſe fears.</note> (as too many doe) with diſtruſtfull and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractfull thoughts and fears about what may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall and happen unto us. Strange it is how Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians do ſometimes diſquiet their own hearts by anticipating of their ſufferings, forecaſting how they ſhould do, in caſe ſuch or ſuch a tryall, ſuch an affliction ſhould happen unto them. O (ſaith one) the afflictions which I feel are great, but thoſe which I fear are far greater. O, if God ſhould bring upon me the evill which I fear, how ſhould I bear it? Should God deal with me as with his ſervant <hi>Job,</hi> or with ſome others of his ſervants, how ſhould I undergoe it? Thus do they diſquiet their ſouls oft times with vain ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of what God (it may be) never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth to do to them; ſo making the burden of the preſent day a great deal heavier then it would be, by pulling to morrows burden upon it. Againſt all theſe cauſeleſſe fears the <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi> in hand may ſerve as a ſoveraign <hi>Cordiall.</hi> God, when he afflicteth his people he doth it <hi>by meaſure,</hi> by a meaſure of <hi>mercy,</hi> proportioning
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:170444:23"/>their ſufferings to their <hi>ſtrength:</hi> So as if he ſhall call any of them to ſufferings above, and beyond their ſtrength, he will make a proportionable ſupply. And if he give a greater meaſure of ſtrength for the bearing of it, it is all one as if the affliction were lighter. And why then ſhould we diſquiet our ſouls with theſe <hi>ifs</hi> and <hi>ands,</hi> theſe doubts and fears of what may come here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after? Come what will come, come what ſhall come, it ſhall not exceed that meaſure, which our wiſe and mercifull God ſeeth fitting and conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient for us.</p>

When a man taketh a thing to heart, and is deeply affected with it, it maketh his bowels yearn and move within him, ſending forth deep ſighs and groans; even ſo was the Lord affected with the condition of that his people. <hi>In all their affliction he was afflicted</hi> (as he elſewhere expreſſeth it) Iſa. 63.9. Even as every ſtroak which a tender Mother giveth unto her dear childe it goeth to her own heart, even ſo is God affected towards his people; when being provoked by their ſins he taketh the Rod in hand, and dealeth ſharply with them, this is ſo far from alienating his fatherly affection from them, that it is hereby rather inflamed and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed.</p>
            <p>A ſtrong <hi>Conſolation,</hi>

Even then when God ſeemeth to be turned their enemy, ſo as they have no ſenſe and feeling of his love and favour towards them, but all things are againſt them, his <hi>countenance</hi> is againſt them, his <hi>hand</hi> is againſt them, he <hi>writeth bitter things againſt them,</hi> (as <hi>Job</hi> ſaith of himſelf, Job 13.26.) proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt them in a way of Judgement, yet even then his heart is towards them.

At this time when <hi>Chriſt</hi> was to drink this bitter <hi>Cup,</hi> to indure theſe bitter ſufferings, God the Father had now put upon himſelf the perſon of a <hi>Judge,</hi> requiring and exacting from him a full ſatisfaction for all the ſins which he as a Surety had undertaken, ſo as his Fatherly affection ſeemed now to be layed aſide, yet even now doth he lay claim to this <hi>Relation,</hi> calling him his <hi>Father,</hi> ſtill looking upon him under the ſame notion.

<pb n="59" facs="tcp:170444:34"/>he did not finde thoſe ſweet influences, and gracious communications from God his Father as formerly he had done, as to his preſent ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion he had even forſaken him, (of which he complains) yet even then he lives by Faith, ſetting that awork, ſtill calling God his God, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> Matth. 27.46. Thus did he by this eye of Faith ſee one contrary in and through another, <hi>Mercy</hi> in the midſt of <hi>Judgement,</hi> a tender <hi>Father</hi> in the habit of an angry <hi>Judge.</hi> And thus learn we of him to live. This is the proper life of a Chriſtian, to live here, not by <hi>ſenſe,</hi> but by <hi>Faith. The life which I now live in the Fleſh I live by the Faith of the Son of God,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul</hi> of himſelf) Gal. 2.20. Whileſt he lived in the Fleſh, in the body, he lived by Faith, Faith in Chriſt, reſting and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying upon Gods grace through him. And thus let us live; and that in all eſtates. Whatever our condition be, however the Lord be pleaſed to deal with us. Suppoſe as (<hi>Hezekiah</hi> complains, Iſa. 38.13.) he <hi>breaketh all our bones as a Lyon,</hi> or that with <hi>Job,</hi> we feel the <hi>Arrowes of the Almighty ſticking in us, the Poyſon whereof drinketh up our ſpirits, and the terrors of God ſet themſelves in array againſt us,</hi> as he ſpeaks (Job 6.4) or that, with <hi>Paul,</hi> we are <hi>troubled on every ſide,</hi> having <hi>fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings without, and terrors within,</hi> (as it was with him, 2 Cor. 7.5.) being exerciſed both with Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall and Spirituall conflicts, in the outward and inward man, (both which Gods dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt children are ſubject to in this life) yet even in this condition ſet faith awork to look through all theſe clouds, that ſo we may behold our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers face, ſee the light of the countenance of
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:170444:35"/>a reconciled God and Father in Chriſt, making diſcovery of his yet continued love and favour to us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> But how ſhall Faith make this diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Why, by looking through the <hi>Glaſſe of the Promiſe,</hi> which repreſents God as he is, not as he ſeemeth to be. And this let us have recourſe unto, hearkening what the Promiſe will ſay to us. In our ſaddeſt extremities when ſenſe and feeling repreſent God unto us as an <hi>Enemy,</hi> now hear what the <hi>Promiſe</hi> ſaith. That will give us aſſurance of what we have heard, that being once our Father, he will be ever our Father. So as though he may be angry with us, yet he will not utterly reject thoſe whom he hath taken in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Covenant with himſelf. <hi>If they break my Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I will viſit their tranſgreſſions with the Rod, and their iniquities with ſtripes; nevertheleſſe my loving kindeneſſe will I not utterly take from him,</hi> (ſo runs that Promiſe forecited.) Now the <hi>word of Promiſe</hi> is a <hi>ſure word,</hi> a word of truth, which God will not fail in the performance of. <hi>I will not ſuffer my faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſse to fail; my Covenant will I not break,</hi> (ſo it there followeth.) And therefore, whatever ſenſe and feeling ſay, hear what the <hi>Promiſe</hi> ſaith, caſting our Anchor upon that ground, <hi>living by Faith</hi> in it.</p>
            <p>It is the want of this that maketh Chriſtians ſo dejected under their afflictions and troubles as often they are.
<note place="margin">Living by <hi>Senſe,</hi> a cauſe of great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections.</note> They live by <hi>ſenſe and feeling,</hi> apprehending God to be as they feel him. Whereas if <hi>Faith</hi> were acted, and ſet a work as it might be, what a conſtant clear Sunſhine day might the life of a Chriſtian be? Were a man
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:170444:35"/>aloft above the Clouds, he ſhould ſee the Sun ſhining clearly in the darkeſt gloomieſt day of Winter; and were the ſoul mounted, (as it might be) by Faith upon the wings of the Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, what a conſtant apprehenſion of Gods love and favour might it injoy? beholding God as a reconciled Father even then when there is nothing but wrath and anger in his face.

Heb. 12.9. <hi>Moreover</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>we have had Fathers of
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:170444:36"/>our bodies which corrected us, and we gave them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence; ſhould we not much rather be in ſubjection to the Father of Spirits?</hi> For within the next Verſe he ſubjoyneth a Reaſon. <hi>For they verily for a few dayes chaſtened us after their pleaſure, but he doth it for our profit, that we might be partakers of his holyneſse,</hi> verſ. 11. Naturall Parents ſometimes prove unnaturall to their children, correcting them in paſſion, it may be out of ſome miſtake, or out of a corrupt judgement, ſo doing more hurt then good by their Corrections. But ſo doth not our <hi>heavenly Father;</hi> who being a wiſe and mercifull God, never correcteth his children but where need is, and then he doth it in ſuch a manner as may be for their ſpiritual advantage, ſo as they may be the better for it.

So doth our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Pattern, our bleſſed Lord and Saviour.

            </p>
            <p>Mark it. Here is the chief and principal Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine that this former part of the Text affords us. <hi>God the Father gave this Cup to his Son Chriſt.</hi> Which in effect, and for ſubſtance ſpeaketh one and the ſame thing with that of the Apoſtle, Rom. 8.32. <hi>God ſpared not his own Son, but deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered him up for us all.</hi> So was it in the <hi>Type, Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> offered up his Son. <hi>By Faith Abraham, when he was tryed, offered up Iſaac, and he that received the Promiſes offered up his only begotten Son,</hi> (ſo the Apoſtle to the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> hath it,) Heb. 11.17. And St. <hi>James</hi> the like. <hi>Was not Abraham our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther juſtified by works, when be had offered up Iſaac his Son upon the Altar?</hi> Jam. 2.21. This did he intentionally, in affection and reſolution, bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Son, and laying him upon the Altar, ſtretching forth his hand with the ſacrificing Knife to ſlay him, as the ſtory ſets it forth, Gen. 22.9, 10. Which in Gods acceptation was all one as if he had done what he purpoſed and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to doe. And ſo was it in the truth of that Type. <hi>God the Father</hi> offers up his <hi>Son,</hi> his only begotten Son <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> offers him up upon the <hi>Altar of the Croſſe.</hi> Where, (as the Prophet <hi>Iſai</hi> deſcribeth his Paſſion) Iſa. 53.10. <hi>It pleaſed the Lord to bruiſe him, he hath put him to grief; when thou ſhalt make his ſoul an offering for ſin,</hi> &amp;c. Thus did <hi>God the Father</hi> give this <hi>bitter Cup</hi> to his <hi>Son;</hi> giving him to ſuffer, and die that painfull, ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, accurſed death of the Croſſe.

            <p>More ſoundly, for the reſolving hereoſ, take we notice, that in every <hi>ſinfull Action</hi> there are two things, the <hi>Materiale</hi> and the <hi>Formale</hi> (as

In a <hi>horſe</hi> that <hi>halteth</hi> there is his <hi>going,</hi> and his <hi>halting,</hi> the one is the <hi>act</hi> it ſelf, the other is the <hi>deficiency</hi> in that act.

Inſtance in the caſe in hand, the <hi>Jewes</hi> putting Chriſt to death, there was the <hi>Act,</hi> their crucifying of him, and the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination</hi> in that act, the <hi>evilneſſe</hi> of the action, which was their doing it without a <hi>warrant,</hi> and with ſuch <hi>evil intents</hi> and <hi>purpoſes</hi> as they did. Now to apply the diſtinction.</p>
            <p>As for the <hi>Act</hi> it ſelf,
<note place="margin">God the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the one, not of the other.</note> that action in the doing whereof the Creature ſinneth, <hi>God</hi> hath a <hi>hand</hi> in it, and that not only in the ordering and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing of it, but <hi>concurring</hi> in it, he being the <hi>principal Agent,</hi> and the Creature only his <hi>Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> in acting of it. But for the <hi>deficiency,</hi> the <hi>inordination,</hi> wherein properly lyeth the <hi>evil</hi> of the <hi>Action,</hi> and ſo the <hi>ſin,</hi> that is the <hi>Creatures</hi> own, God is not the <hi>Author</hi> of that, nor any <hi>cauſe</hi> of it at all. This is a <hi>mans own work,</hi> the fruit of his own <hi>Corruption,</hi> which is properly the <hi>Mother</hi> of all <hi>ſin,</hi> as <hi>Satan</hi> is the <hi>Father</hi> of it. How this may be, thoſe forenamed <hi>ſimilitudes</hi> do very fitly illuſtrate. A man that ſpurreth a <hi>lame horſe,</hi> or ſtrikes a <hi>cracked Bell,</hi> he is the cauſe of the <hi>motion</hi> of the one, and of the <hi>ſounding</hi> of the other, but not of the <hi>halting</hi> or <hi>jarring;</hi> that is from
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:170444:49"/>themſelves. So here, the <hi>motion</hi> or <hi>action</hi> is from God, without whom (as I told you) the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture cannot move, but the <hi>deficiency</hi> therein is from man himſelf.

            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> So indeed ſome <hi>Hereticks</hi> of old aſſerted it, that Chriſt ſuffered not only in his <hi>humane</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as <hi>Man,</hi> but alſo in his <hi>Divine</hi> nature as <hi>God.</hi> From whence they were called by the name of <hi>Theopaſſians;</hi> who have not wanted ſome to follow them in after-ages, and ſome of late times. But this is juſtly condemned as an Error, a groſs one, aſſerting a plain impoſſibility. True it is, <hi>all things are poſſible with God,</hi> viz. to doe them, but himſelf not <hi>paſſible</hi> in any thing, ſo as to ſuffer from his Creature. <hi>Chriſt</hi> as <hi>God</hi> he could not ſuffer, he could not dye; the divine nature being <hi>impaſſible,</hi> as well as <hi>immortall.</hi> A Truth fitly illuſtrated by a familiar ſimilitude. Whileſt the <hi>Axe</hi> heweth a piece of <hi>Timber</hi> upon which the
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:170444:52"/>
               <hi>Sun</hi> ſhineth, the <hi>Wood</hi> is cut, but the <hi>Sun-beams</hi> not touched, they ſtill remain impaſſible. Even ſo was it in the <hi>Paſſion of Chriſt;</hi> the <hi>humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> ſuffered, but not ſo the <hi>Divine.</hi> Though uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto the humane whileſt it ſuffered, yet it remained impaſſible. As it is with the <hi>ſoul</hi> and <hi>body</hi> in man, though both be united together whileſt the man ſuffereth ſome corporal puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet the <hi>Body</hi> properly feeleth the ſmart of it, the <hi>ſoul</hi> not ſuffering, ſave only by way of <hi>ſympathie.</hi> So was it here in the ſufferings of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the <hi>Godhead</hi> and <hi>Manhood</hi> were both united in the <hi>Perſon</hi> ſuffering, but the <hi>Godhead</hi> ſuffered not. So as we muſt then conclude it, that the whole <hi>Perſon</hi> of Chriſt ſuffered, but properly in, or according to his <hi>humane nature.</hi> So Scripture explains it ſelf. <hi>Chriſt ſuffered for ſins, &amp;c. being put to death in the Fleſh,</hi> (ſaith St. <hi>Peter</hi>) 1 Pet. 3.18. And again, in the Chapter following, <hi>verſ.</hi> 1. <hi>Chriſt ſuffered for us in the Fleſh.</hi>] It was <hi>Chriſt</hi> that ſuffered.

               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

It was the <hi>humane nature</hi> of Chriſt, or the <hi>Perſon</hi> of Chriſt in and according to his humane nature, which properly ſuffered.</p>
            <p>And this he did in his <hi>whole man,</hi>

Now if <hi>this green tree</hi> were thus uſed, <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf, who was a juſt and a righteous perſon, having no guilt, no juſt matter of condemnation in him, (ſave only as he ſtood in the place of ſinners) if he were thus left to ſuffer ſuch things as he did from them, what then had they cauſe to expect, who in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of their manifold impieties were fit fuel for the fire of Gods wrath to feed upon? And let it in like manner be applyed to all wicked and ungodly perſons, who being no better then <hi>drye trees,</hi> having no ſap of grace in them, voyd and deſtitute of all goodneſſe, and ſo no other but <hi>Veſſels of wrath fitted for destruction,</hi> (as the Apoſtle calleth them, Rom. 9.22.) if it was thus done to this <hi>green tree,</hi> this ſo juſt and righteous a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, what do they think will become of them? This uſe St. <hi>Peter</hi> makes of the ſufferings of Gods <hi>Saints,</hi> wherewith God is pleaſed ſometimes to exerciſe them, 1 Pet. 4.17. <hi>If Judgement first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin at us, what ſhall the end be of them that obey not the Goſpell of God?

And ſuch uſe make we of this deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>God</hi> with his own <hi>Son</hi> after this manner. Did <hi>God</hi> his <hi>Father</hi> give ſuch a <hi>Cup</hi> to him, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that he was in all things his <hi>obedient Son,</hi> (as the Apoſtle tells us, Phil. 2.8.) Oh what then may the <hi>children of Diſobedience</hi> expect and look for? Certainly there is a black Cloud which hangeth over their heads, even the wrath of God, which without repentance ſhall be poured out upon them. <hi>Becauſe of theſe things</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle, ſpeaking of wicked and ungodly courſes and practiſes) <hi>cometh the wrath of God upon the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of diſobedience,</hi> Eph. 5.6. And this let all ſuch make account of, taking notice that God hath a <hi>Cup</hi> for them, and that a dreadfull one. <hi>In the hand of the Lord there is a Cup,</hi> (ſaith the Pſalmiſt) <hi>and the wine is red, it is full of mixture, and he poureth out of the ſame, but the dregs thereof all the wicked of the earth ſhall wring them out, and drink them,</hi> Pſal. 75.8. So it is, God the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Moderator, and wiſe diſpoſer of all things, he hath appointed and meaſured out afflictions and ſufferings to all the Sons of men, ſo as his own people have their ſhare in them, they are made to drink of this Cup, to taſte of it, I but the wicked and ungodly ſhall drink of it after another manner, they ſhall <hi>wring out the dregs
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:170444:60"/>thereof,</hi> and drink them. God hath terrible Judgements in ſtore for them ſuch as ſhall end in endleſſe deſpair, and utter deſtruction. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon the wicked he ſhall rain ſnares, fire and brimstome, and an horrible tempeſt, this ſhall be the portion of their Cup,</hi> (ſo the Pſalmiſt ſets it forth) Pſal. 11.6. And O that this were but ſeriouſly thought of by all of this number! that all profane, and ungodly perſons would but conſider this! that amidſt their Oath-<hi>Cups,</hi> thoſe <hi>Cups of abomination,</hi> wherewith they are intoxicated, they would but take notice of this <hi>Cup</hi> in the hand of the Lord, this <hi>Cup of red wine,</hi> his fierce wrath, which is reſerved for them to drink! Certainly the very thought here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, being let into their ſouls, it could not but fill them with horror and terror. So did the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of this <hi>Cup,</hi> which our bleſſed <hi>Saviour</hi> ſaw coming towards him, work upon him, it put him into a ſtrange and unheard of Agony, (as the ſtory ſets it forth.) And certainly ſuch ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration would the like apprehenſion have upon the moſt obdurate and obſtinate ſinner, did he but ſeriouſly think of the fierceneſs of that wrath which one day without repentance he ſhall be ſure to feel, it could not but work horror and terror in his ſoul.</p>

So then to <hi>drink</hi> this Cup is no more but to ſuffer that death. A metaphoricall expreſſion of frequent uſe among the Heathen, with whom <hi>Eodem peculo hibere, to drink of the ſame Cup,</hi> was a Proverbial ſpeech, ſignifying a partaking of, and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating in the ſame calamities. So in phraſe of <hi>Scripture</hi> we meet with it often, both in the <hi>Old</hi> Teſtament and <hi>New.</hi> As in that Text which I have formerly had recourſe to, Jer. 25. where the Prophet is ſent by God with the <hi>Wine-cup of his fury</hi> to cauſe the Nations to drink it, verſ. 15, 16, 17. &amp; 26, 27, 28. (in every of which we meet with the ſame words uſed in the ſame ſenſe) that is to partake in the Judgements and Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which God would bring upon them. So we finde it plainly expounded in the 49 Chap. of the ſame Propheſie (a Text alſo before made uſe of,) where the Prophet ſpeaking to the <hi>Edo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites,</hi> verſ. 12. <hi>Behold</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>they whoſe judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was not to drink of the Cup, have aſſuredly drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and art thou he that ſhalt goe altogether unpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed? thou ſhalt not goe unpuniſhed, but thou ſhalt ſurely drink of it;</hi> the one explaining the other, To <hi>drink of the Cup</hi> is to ſeel the Judgements of God. So again in the <hi>New</hi> Teſtament. <hi>Are ye
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:170444:64"/>able to drink of the Cup that I am to drink of?</hi> (ſaith our Saviour to the Sons of <hi>Zebedee,</hi> Matth. 20.22.) that is, to ſuffer what I am to ſuffer. Thus they who worſhipped the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> or received his <hi>mark</hi> (the followers of <hi>Antichriſt)</hi> are threatned, Rev. 14.10. <hi>The ſame ſhall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the Cup of his indignation.</hi> Which the next words explain, <hi>[And he ſhall be tormented with fire and brimſtone]</hi> Thus to <hi>drink</hi> is to <hi>ſuffer.</hi> So look we upon it in the Text. <hi>The Cup which my Father hath given me, ſhall I not drink it?</hi> that is, ſuffer what he hath appointed and layed out for me.</p>

Whatever wrongs and injuries his enemies did unto him, he bare all patiently, not giving an ill word to any of them; yet ſee here how he taketh up <hi>Peter</hi> for this his friendly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. Not only rejecting the <hi>Counſell,</hi> but the <hi>Counſellor</hi> alſo, whom he would not indure in his ſight, bidding him <hi>Avant, Get thee behinde me,]</hi> Language one would think fitter for a <hi>Dog</hi> then a <hi>Diſciple,</hi> an <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> a <hi>chief Apostle.</hi> Nay more, <hi>Get thee behinde me Satan,] Satan,</hi> the word ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth properly an <hi>Adverſary,</hi> and therefore in Scripture commonly given to the <hi>Devil,</hi> the Arch-adverſary to <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man.</hi> And this tearm (then which he could not have found a worſe) doth our <hi>Saviour</hi> give unto <hi>Peter</hi> for his ſuggeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this counſell to him, wherein he was an <hi>Adverſary</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> oppoſing his will, and an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary to <hi>Man,</hi> going about to hinder his ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; as alſo an Adverſary to <hi>Christ,</hi> in taking him off from his work, from his obedience. Thus did our Saviour there look upon him, as an Inſtrument of <hi>Satan,</hi> actuated and ſet awork by him in the handing of this Temptation, which tended to the taking him off from the work, which his <hi>Father</hi> had given him to doe. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he rejecteth his counſell, and that with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation, though to fleſh and blood never ſo acceptable. Never ſhould the counſels, ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions, attempts, endeavours of any finde bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter entertainment with a Chriſtian, which tend to ſuch an end, to the hindering of him in the courſe of his obedience unto God, whether in doing or ſuffering his will, whatever the <hi>Perſon</hi> be from whom they come, though never ſo <hi>neer,</hi>
               <pb n="129" facs="tcp:170444:69"/>whatever the <hi>Affection</hi> be from which they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, though never ſo <hi>dear,</hi> whatever the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention</hi> be, though never ſo <hi>good,</hi> yet herein hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken not to them, but looking upon them as In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of Satan, actuated and ſet awork by him, reject their indeavours. So did holy <hi>Job,</hi> when his <hi>Wife</hi> gave him that counſell which we meet with, Job 2.9. bidding him, <hi>Curſe God and die,</hi> or (as it may be read) <hi>Bleſſe God and die,</hi> for the word <hi>Barach</hi> there uſed ſignifieth both, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedicere &amp; maledicere,</hi> Bleſſing and Curſing, and in Scripture it is moſt frequently uſed in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſenſe, ſeldome in the latter, and ſo Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which ſtill inclines to the better part, may induce us to conſtrue it there; But however it be, her meaning was, ſhe would have <hi>Job</hi> uſe ſome means, that he might have a ſpeedy riddance out of that trouble and miſery wherein he was, which ſhe thought to be beſt for him. Now what ſaith <hi>Job</hi> to her? You have it in the next verſe, <hi>v.</hi> 10. <hi>Thou ſpeakeſt as one of the fooliſh women ſpeaketh.</hi> Thus he who in all his ſufferings before had not ſhewen any the leaſt <hi>Paſſion,</hi> ſave that of <hi>ſorrow,</hi> not an angry poſture or expreſſion, now his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is ſtirred within him, ſo as he rejecteth this counſell of his Wife not without indignation, caſting it back in her face with a tart Reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. <hi>Thou ſpeakeſt as one of the fooliſh women ſpeaketh,</hi> or, as a <hi>wicked woman,</hi> (for ſo that word <hi>[fooliſh]</hi> in Scripture is often taken.) And why is he ſo an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with her? Why inaſmuch as this counſell of hers (make the beſt of it) tended to the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him off from the courſe of his <hi>Paſſive Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,</hi> to make him throw away the <hi>bitter Cup</hi> which God had given him, before he had drunk
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:170444:70"/>it out. So himſelf giveth the reaſon of this his impatience in the next words; <hi>What, ſhall we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive good at the hands of God, and ſhall we not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive evil?</hi> Shall we drink the <hi>ſweet Cup</hi> of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity, and ſhall we not alſo drink the <hi>bitter Cup</hi> of Adverſity, if God ſee it fitting for us? Thus doth he reject that counſell which tended to the taking him off from his ſuffering work, and ſo from his obedience to God.</p>
            <p>And the like let all of us be exhorted to do.

Thus did he at the firſt convey that poyſonous <hi>Apple</hi> to our firſt Parent <hi>Adam,</hi> through the hand of his <hi>ſecond-ſelf,</hi> her that was neareſt and deareſt to him, his <hi>Wife,</hi> Gen. 3.6.

And ſo do poyſonous ſuggeſtions, being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed by a friend, a familiar, and ſo mixed with declarations of affection and love, they finde an eaſier paſſage to the heart, they are more readily received and embraced. Great need therefore have we to be wary and cautious, not taking the ſervices of others (whoever they be) upon truſt, knowing that they being ſubject to be deceived themſelves, may become Inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:170444:70"/>in deceiving of others. And therefore bring we them to the Touchſtone, to the <hi>ballance of the Sanctuary,</hi> trying and examining whether they be <hi>for God,</hi> or <hi>against</hi> him; whether they perſwade obedience to his will, or diſſwade from it.

So then, love and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect thy <hi>Friend</hi> ſtill, but abhor <hi>Satan,</hi> though in a friend. <hi>Peter</hi> was the ſame in <hi>Christs</hi> eye ſtill, when he diſſwaded him from going up to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that he was before, ſtill he loved <hi>Peter,</hi> I, but <hi>Get thee behinde me Satan.</hi> Take we heed of ſo reſpecting our <hi>Friends,</hi> as to hearken to <hi>Satan</hi> in them.

But what ſaith <hi>Paul</hi> to the motion? what ear doth he lend them? what Anſwer doth he return them? you may read it in the <hi>verſe</hi> following, (<hi>v.</hi> 13.) <hi>What do ye weeping and breaking my heart?

But herein as our own conſciences acquit us, ſo we doubt not but our Lord and Maſter, whoſe ſervants we are, will, whileſt we only deſign the keeping of this Ordinance of his pure, by not proſtituting of it to a promiſcuous participation; whereby as the Ordinance would be polluted, ſo the ſouls of many would be indangered, who by eating and drinking at the Lords Table unworthily, might <hi>eat and drink their own Damnation.</hi> This we muſt profeſſe we would not willingly be acceſſory to. But as for thoſe to whom this Sacrament might be a hopefull means for the furthering of their ſalvation, ſuch as are in any meaſure meet to be partakers of it, we are ſo far from keeping them from it, or it from them, that we hold it forth to them, deſiring, intreating, beſeeching, nay in the name of God requiring and commanding them, and that under a threatned penalty, (which in the language of the Parable is called a <hi>compell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> them, Luk. 14.23.) to come, and lay claim to this, which we acknowledge to be their right. Only we deſire that this may be done in a <hi>regular and orderly way,</hi> ſo as that the <hi>hedge</hi> may not be broken down, and layed open, which ſhould keep others at a diſtance from it, who have no ſuch right unto it. But I hope that this is a thing ſo evident unto candid and unprejudiced ſpirits, as that it ſhall not need any further vindication. Thus I have alſo done with the <hi>third Particular</hi> here intimated unto us in this <hi>Interrogation;</hi> And ſo with the former conſideration of theſe words, as they contain in them a <hi>Reprehenſion</hi> and <hi>Check</hi> to <hi>Peter.</hi>

This it was that induced <hi>God the Father</hi> to give this <hi>Gup</hi> to his <hi>Son. God ſo loved the World that he gave his only begotten Son,</hi> &amp;c. Joh. 3.16.

<pb n="148" facs="tcp:170444:79"/>It is but a groundleſſe conceit of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that by his ſufferings, he merited the glorifying of his Humane nature.

As our <hi>works</hi> are to us, ſo were Chriſts <hi>ſufferings</hi> to him; <hi>Via ad regnum, non cauſa regnandi,</hi> the <hi>way</hi> to his <hi>Kingdome,</hi> not the <hi>cauſe</hi> of his <hi>reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> He had no need to merit any thing for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: For, as he was <hi>God,</hi> ſo he was coequall with the <hi>Father,</hi> infinitely bleſſed and happy from all eternity, and ſo there could come no acceſſion or addition of glory to him from his ſufferings, only a reaſſuming of that glory, which for a time he had layd aſide. And as he was <hi>Man,</hi> ſo (by the <hi>Papiſts</hi> own confeſſion) he was <hi>compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſor, non viator,</hi> even from the very firſt inſtant of his conception, he was made bleſſed, by the union of the <hi>divine</hi> nature with the <hi>humane,</hi> from which union alſo flowed the glorifying of the Humane nature after it had ſuffered. But I will not ſtand to diſpute the Controverſie with them. This we are ſure of, the ſpirit of God in Scripture, ſpeaking of the Death and Paſſion of Chriſt, it ſtill refers the merit, fruit and benefit of it unto us. Hereby were we redeemed, and reconciled unto God.

And ſo they go on ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely in their ſins, promiſing to themſelves ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, that they ſhall not feel of the Judgments of God. So was it (as with <hi>literall,</hi> Iſa. 47.8. ſo) with <hi>Myſticall Babylon,</hi> Rev. 18.7. <hi>She ſaith in her heart, I ſit a Queen, and am no Widow, and ſhall ſee no ſorrow.</hi> Being in a proſperous and flouriſhing condition, ſhe promiſeth to her ſelf that ſhe ſhould never ſee a change.

Expreſſe to this purpoſe is that known Text, (which I wiſh all of this rank may take notice of,) Deut. 29.19, 20.

               <note place="margin">Such as will not ſee it when it cometh to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them.</note> who when this <hi>bitter Cup</hi> is coming towards them, yet they <hi>ſhut their eyes againſt it,</hi> ſo as ſeeing they will not ſee it. Such the Prophet <hi>Iſai</hi> ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of, Iſa. 26.11. <hi>Lord</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>when thy hand is lifted up they will not ſee.</hi> Notwithſtanding God was at work, wonderfully declaring and manifeſting his power, as in working miraculous deliverances for his people, ſo in executing ſtrange and remarkable Judgements upon his and their enemies, yet they ſhut their eyes againſt it, not regarding what he did. Even ſo deal many. When <hi>Gods hand is lifted up,</hi> and his Judgements are abroad in the earth, this <hi>Cup</hi> is walking to and fro on every ſide of them, yet they ſhut their eyes againſt it, will not take notice of it ſo as to be at all affected with it. Though it be coming towards them, yet they hope it ſhall not come at them, ſo was it with thoſe <hi>Edomites,</hi> whom I ſpake of before: Though the <hi>Cup</hi> of Gods fury went round among the Nations, ſo as all their Neighbours had drunk of it, yet they hoped they ſhould not do the like. Even ſo is it with many <hi>ſecure ſinners.</hi> In the midſt of common
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:170444:86"/>calamities, they promiſe to themſelves immuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and freedome, that this <hi>Cup</hi> ſhall paſſe by them. So did the <hi>Jewes</hi> of old, though the Lord ſent his <hi>Prophets</hi> to them one after another, every one with a <hi>Cup</hi> in his hand, (as the Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> there ſaith of himſelf in that Text fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited, Jer. 25.) <hi>a Cup of wrath and fury,</hi> which they held forth unto them, threatning them with the Judgements of God, yet few of them gave credit to what they ſaid. But what ſaith the Lord to them for this? You may read it (as often elſewhere, ſo) Amos 9.10. <hi>All the ſinners of my people ſhall die by the Sword, which ſay, the evil ſhall not overtake nor prevent us.] The Sinners of my people,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous ſinners, (ſuch as the greateſt part of them were) though God had threatned his Judgements againſt that Nation, yet they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther feared, nor cared for them, they would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve no more then they felt, ſtill they flattered themſelves, that the Judgements threatned either ſhould not come, or not come at them, they ſhould do well enough. Now as for ſuch, the Lord there tells them what they ſhould expect, they ſhould be ſure to <hi>dye by the Sword,</hi> whoever eſcaped his Judgements they ſhould not. And the like let all ſecure ſinners look for. Such as <hi>make a Covenant with death, and with Hell they are at an agreement,</hi> (as the Prophet <hi>Iſai</hi> ſets forth the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of the <hi>Rulers of Iſrael,</hi> Iſa. 28.15) <hi>ſaying in their hearts,</hi> (as it there followeth) <hi>when the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing ſcourge ſhall paſſe through, it ſhall not come unto us.</hi> Thus do they (as he goeth on) <hi>make lyes their refuge, and under falſhood do they hide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</hi> But let all ſuch make account that this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of theirs ſhall be diſanulled. So the Lord
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:170444:86"/>there threatens it againſt thoſe Rulers, <hi>verſ.</hi> 18. <hi>Your Covenant with death ſhall be diſanulled, and your agreement with Hell ſhall not stand, when the overflowing ſcourge ſhall paſſe through, then ye ſhall be trodden down by it.</hi> Secure ſinners ſhall not eſcape the Judgements of God. They who when his hand is lifted up will not ſee, they ſhall ſee and feel. So the Prophet there threatneth them in that Text even now cited, Iſa. 26.11. <hi>Lord, when thy hand is lifted up they will not ſee, but they ſhall ſee and be aſhamed, yea the fire of thine enemies ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour them.] The fire of thine enemies,</hi> the fierce wrath of God, wherewith he is wont to proceed againſt his enemies. When that ſhould break forth upon them (as it ſhould) then they ſhould ſee what they would not ſee, they ſhould feel the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God to their coſt and ſmart.

Thus we read, when the <hi>Angels</hi> were pouring out their <hi>Vials,</hi> men <hi>blaſphemed the Name of God.</hi> So we finde it thrice repeated in that one Chapter, Rev. 16 <hi>v.</hi> 9.11.21. looking at him, as <hi>having power over thoſe plagues,</hi>

            <p>Yea a ſpice of this diſtemper may ſometimes (too often) be found even in <hi>Gods own people.</hi>

               <note place="margin">The Quality of them, as qualified by Chriſt.</note> Such are all <hi>Afflictions,</hi> all fruits and conſequents of ſin, and puniſhments of it, every one being an Appendix to that firſt Curſe, <hi>The day thou eateſt thereof thou ſhalt dye the death;</hi> ſurely die, Gen. 2.17. that is, be ſubject to manifold evils, as in ſoul, ſo in body, tending to death, to the deſtruction of both. But by &amp; through <hi>Chriſt</hi> their nature is now altered, the <hi>Curſe</hi> is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away. That was one, and the chief, of thoſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients, which was put into this <hi>Cup,</hi> which was given to <hi>Chriſt</hi> to drink, and which he did drink upon the Croſſe. He being there made ſubject to that accurſed death, that he might free us from the <hi>Curſe</hi> of <hi>death,</hi> and of all its retinue. <hi>Chriſt hath redeemed us from the Curſe of the Law, being made a curſe for us,</hi> Gal. 3.13. So that what the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſaith of <hi>Death</hi> it ſelf, 1 Cor. 15.55. <hi>O Death where is thy ſting?</hi> We may ſay the ſame of whatever afflictions and croſſes can befall the children of God upon earth; their <hi>Sting</hi> is gone. <hi>Surely the bitterneſſe of death is past,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Agag,</hi> having (as he thought) armed himſelf againſt the fear of it, which is the greateſt part of Deaths bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,) 1 Sam. 15.32. And the like may all true Believers ſay concerning all their <hi>Afflictions,</hi> and ſufferings. The <hi>bitterneſſe</hi> of them is paſt, as to them, the <hi>Curſe</hi> being taken away from them by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which is indeed the chief part of their bitterneſſe. Even as <hi>Moſes</hi> altered the quality of
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:170444:99"/>thoſe <hi>waters</hi> of <hi>Marah,</hi> took away the bitterneſſe of them, by caſting into them that <hi>Tree</hi> which the Lord had ſhewed him, ſo hath Chriſt taken away the bitterneſſe of all the <hi>waters of Affliction</hi> by the <hi>Tree</hi> of his <hi>Croſſe,</hi> to which he was deſigned by his Father. The <hi>bitterneſſe</hi> of Afflictions (as I ſaid) was the <hi>Curſe</hi> going along with them, they being in themſelves all tokens of <hi>wrath.</hi> But now, that <hi>bitterneſſe,</hi> that <hi>Curſe</hi> is taken away. So as to true Believers they are no longer tokens of wrath, but rather <hi>Love-tokens. Whom the Lord loveth, he correcteth,</hi> Prov. 3.12. <hi>chaſteneth,</hi> Heb. 12.6. Yea, <hi>Pledges of Adoption.</hi> So it there fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, Heb. 12.6, 7. <hi>He ſcourgeth every Son whom he receiveth. If ye endure chaſtenings, God dealeth with you as with Sons.</hi> Not to know what <hi>Chaſtiſements</hi> mean, it is no good ſign. <hi>If ye be without Chastiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whereof all</hi> (all Gods children) <hi>are partakers, then are ye baſtards and not ſons,</hi> (ſo it there fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth) <hi>v.</hi> 8. For God to exerciſe his Children with afflictions, it is a ſign that he owns them for his Children, and a demonſtration of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly love to them, and care of them. Thus do theſe <hi>Cups</hi> which Gods people drink of, they come from the hand of a <hi>Father,</hi> not of a <hi>Judge,</hi> being to them not <hi>ſatisfactory,</hi> but <hi>castigatory</hi> puniſhments. Not properly <hi>puniſhments,</hi> but <hi>Chaſtiſements.</hi> Not tokens of <hi>wrath,</hi> but <hi>Love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tokens.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A uſefull and comfortable meditation, for the ſoul of a Believer to feed upon in the midſt of whatever diſtreſſe. What is it that maketh theſe <hi>Cups</hi> ſo bitter unto the ſoul? Why, when it look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth upon them, as they are in themſelves, as Cups of divine wrath and fury. Now, no wonder if
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:170444:100"/>it ſhake and tremble at the drinking of them. So long as a man apprehends theſe <hi>Arrowes</hi> which he feeleth to ſtick faſt in him, to be <hi>poyſoned</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes, ſhot at him by the hand of a revenging God, now no wonder if the ſoul have no peace, no quiet. But look upon them as they are changed and altered by Chriſt, having the <hi>Curſe</hi> taken away, and as they are tokens and <hi>pledges</hi> of <hi>Adoption,</hi> (which being ſanctified they certainly are) the ſoul being perſwaded of this, this will be as a ſoveraign Cordial to it, to keep it from fainting.</p>

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> what effect have they upon your ſoules?

If they have ſuch a kindly working upon the ſoul, as to purge out corruption and to ſtrengthen the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardman,</hi> ſo as the ſoul is bettered by them, made more bumble, more watchfull, more fearfull of offending God, more carefull of walking be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him in well pleaſing, hence may a Chriſtian conclude that theſe <hi>are medicinable Cups,</hi> fatherly chaſtiſements, intended for his good.

And again, v. 71. <hi>It is good for me that I have been afflicted, that I might learn thy ſtatutes?</hi> Thus where afflictions have ſuch a kindly work upon the ſoul, where <hi>Nocumenta</hi> are <hi>Documenta,</hi> where <hi>Chastening</hi> and <hi>Teaching</hi> go together, this is a good and a ſure ſign that they are tokens of <hi>Love,</hi> and not of <hi>Wrath, Bleſſed is the man whom thou chaſteneſt, O Lord, and teacheſt
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:170444:101"/>out of thy Law!</hi> Pſal. 94.12. Doe we find this eff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ect in our ſelves? Doe we find ſuch a kindly ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of our afflictions? Doe we find them ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring up in us <hi>filial affections</hi> towards God? not a ſervile and ſlaviſh, but a filial, a childlike fear of his Majeſty, a fear to offend, to diſpleaſe him? a religious care of walking before him, and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving our ſelves unto him? with an utter hatred and deteſtation of all ſin? from hence conclude we our afflictions to be ſuch, not <hi>Puniſhments,</hi> but <hi>Chastiſements,</hi> not tokens of <hi>Wrath,</hi> but <hi>Love,</hi> which being rightly apprehended and believed, will be of great uſe to bear up the ſoul under them.</p>

<pb n="195" facs="tcp:170444:102"/>3.10. An hour, nay a <hi>minute,</hi> a <hi>moment, His anger indureth but a moment,</hi> Pſal. 30.5. <hi>our light afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which is but for a moment,</hi> 2 Cor. 4.17. <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, Thus is the ſpirit of God in Scripture pleaſed to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs and ſet forth the ſhort continuance of the ſufferings of Gods Saints. They are but for a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, a little ſeaſon, a night, an hour, a moment; At the moſt but for the <hi>preſent time,</hi> as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle there hath it, Rom. 8.18. <hi>The ſufferings of this preſent time;</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the time that now is, or this <hi>now ſeaſon,</hi> meaning this preſent life, which being compared with <hi>eternity,</hi> is but a <hi>moment.</hi> And herewith let all Gods Saints comfort themſelves in their ſuffering conditions. Though their ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings may be great, yet they ſhall not be long. <hi>Si gravis brevis,</hi> Far cariage (we ſay) maketh a light burden heavie, and a heavie one intolerable. But the burdens of Gods Saints ſhall not lye long up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their backs. What though at the preſent they lye under the preſſures and oppreſſions of wicked and unreaſonable men, either under their hands, or under their tongues, ſuffering by them in their eſtates, good names, liberties, Perſons, yet let them bear up their ſpirits, taking notice of what the Pſalmiſt tels them, <hi>The rod,</hi> (or <hi>Scepter) of the wicked</hi> (of Tyrannical oppreſſors) <hi>ſhall not reſt upon the lot of the righteous.</hi> Pſal. 125.3. It may be for the preſent they feele <hi>a thorn in the fleſh,</hi> conflicting with ſome ſatanicall temptation, which is to their ſouls as a thorn ſticking in their fleſh, putting them to a great deal of ſmart and trouble, but let not this diſcourage them, taking notice of what the Apoſtle aſſureth them, <hi>The God of peace ſhall ſhortly tread down Satan under your feet,</hi> Rom. 16.20. At the preſent (it may be) they are under a
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:170444:103"/>cloud a black cloud of <hi>ſpiritual deſertion,</hi> God, hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his face from them, nay <hi>writing bitter things againſt them</hi> (as <hi>Job</hi> ſaith he did againſt him, Job. 13.26.) which of all them is the ſaddeſt tryall. No affliction like unto this, <hi>The ſpirit of a man can ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain his infirmity</hi> (his bodily? infirmity, which is much born up by a cheerful ſpirit, ſpecially when there is peace of conſcience with it) <hi>but a wounded ſpirit who can bear?</hi> Prov. 18.14. When God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſeemeth to turn enemy to a man, withdrawing from him the ſenſe and feeling of his love, yea let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting fall ſome drops of wrath upon the ſoul, noe tryall, noe Affliction like unto this. <hi>Tranquillus Deus tranquillat omnia, Where God is at peace with a man nothing can diſquiet him;</hi> but where God ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth war againſt the ſoul who ſhall ſpeak peace to it? Yet ſtill let the true believer bear up, not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving way to deſpondencie, to fainting of ſoul. The <hi>Sun</hi> is often under a cloud, yet it breaketh forth again, and that ſometimes ſuddainly, unexpected<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and ſhineth it may be, more clearly then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was ſo clouded, God will not hide his face from his people for ever. It is but for a while, a little while. <hi>For a ſmal moment have I forſaken thee; but with great mercy will I gather thee. In a little wrath I hid my face from thee, for a moment, but with ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting kindneſſe will I have mercy on thee ſaith the Lord thy Redeemer,</hi> (ſo runs that excellent promiſe made to the Church, which every true beleiver may apply to himſelf) Iſai, 54. <hi>v.</hi> 7.8. Thus if Chriſt do withdraw himſelf from the believing ſoul (as he did from his <hi>Spouſe</hi> in the <hi>Canticles,</hi> Cant. 3.) yet ſeeking after him, it ſhall find him again (as ſhe there did, <hi>v.</hi> 4.) <hi>It was but a little that I paſſed from them</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>watchmen of whom</hi> ſhe enquired
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:170444:103"/>for him) <hi>but I found him whom my ſoul loveth.</hi> His withdrawings are but for a little while. So he tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth his <hi>Diſciples</hi> when he was to leave them, Joh. 16.16. <hi>A little while and ye ſhall not ſee me, and again a little while and ye ſhall ſee me.</hi> Though he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew his <hi>Corporall</hi> preſence from them, (which he did by his death) yet he would appear to them again (which he did after his reſurrection,) and they ſhould enjoy his <hi>ſpirituall</hi> preſence upon earth, and his <hi>glorious</hi> preſence in heaven, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he was going. Thus thoſe who are once tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly united unto Chriſt ſhall never be quite ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from him. If he eſtrange himſelf from them, it is but for a ſeaſon. And therefore in theſe ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes let them live by faith, ſetting that awork to bear up the ſoul. Remember that whatever the affliction be, whether outward or inward, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>temporall,</hi> or <hi>ſpirituall,</hi> yet it is but <hi>temporarie.</hi> Suppoſe it be for weeks, months, years, nay for the whole life time, yet (as I ſaid) compared with <hi>Eternity,</hi> it is but a minute, a moment, <hi>our life</hi> it ſelf is no more; our <hi>affliction</hi> then cannot be long. And ſhal we then faint at the drinking of this <hi>Cup? what, could ye not watch with me one hour?</hi> (ſaith our Saviour to his diſciples) Matth. 26.40. And ſo let me here ſay, what, can we not ſuffer with Chriſt one hour, one minute, who look to reign with him to all eternity? what ever our affliction then be, yet hold up head and heart for a while, a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle while. <hi>A while and for ever.</hi> Above the <hi>Moone</hi> there are no clouds, noe changes in heaven. It will not be long <hi>ere God ſhall wipe away all tears from the eies of his people,</hi> Rev. 7.17. There is the third Conſideration, the <hi>ſhort continuance of Afflictions.</hi>

               <hi>Law</hi> which hath made it common to all of that Sex, <hi>In ſorrow ſhalt thou bring forth children,</hi> Gen. 3.16.

            <p>Thus do they ſtrengthen <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>confidence</hi> in God. <hi>Paul</hi> telleth us,
<note place="margin">Faith.</note> that he <hi>received the ſentence of death in himſelf</hi> to this end, that he might <hi>not truſt in himſelf, but in God, who raiſeth the dead,</hi> 2 Cor. 1.9. And St. <hi>Peter</hi> tells the Saints to whom he writeth, 1 Pet. 1.6, 7. <hi>Now for a ſeaſon</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ye are in heavineſſe through manifold temptations, that the tryall of your Faith being much more precious then Gold that periſheth, though it be tryed with fire, might be found unto praiſe, honour and glery, at the appearing of Jeſus Chriſt.

<pb n="207" facs="tcp:170444:108"/>Argument to induce us to bear whatever tryals God ſhall pleaſe here to exerciſe us with. <hi>We have had Fathers of our fleſh</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>which corrected us, and we gave them reverence, ſhall we not much ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be in ſubjection to the Father of Spirits, and live?</hi> Heb. 12.9. <hi>Live,</hi> the life of <hi>grace</hi> here, of which he ſpeaks in the Verſe following, [<hi>That we might be partakers of his holyneſſe,</hi>] and the life of <hi>Glory</hi> hereafter. Which while a Chriſtian hath an eye at, it may well keep his heart from fainting.

            </p>
            <p>Thus you ſee a gathering of theſe fruits (ſome few among many) which afflictions being ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied doe yeild.

            <p>Being now like one caſt into a deep pit, he had no way to look but upwards, heavenwards; and thither doth he looke; fixing his eye upon his God, and comforting himſelf in him.

As for other things, eſtate, good name, liberty, near and dear Relations, yea and life it ſelf, may be taken away, but ſo cannot his God.

            <p>Here is the <hi>Generall Leſſon,</hi> which all Chriſts
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:170444:121"/>Diſciples are to learn, and practiſe.

As alſo how they ought to ſubmit to God in every of theſe, and upon what grounds they are to do it. But this I foreſee would be a long work. And I conceive that thoſe <hi>Generals</hi> which have been already held forth are fitly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable to every of theſe, or whatever other Particular caſes. And therefore ſhall I not enter into that ſo large a field.</p>
            <p>Only looking into this Cup which our bleſſed Saviour was now to drinke,
<note place="margin">Two bitter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients in our Saviours Cup.

            <p>And the like are Chriſtians to doe if ever God ſhall call them to the like tryals.

            <p>Now as to theſe two particulars, being of ſo great importance, and having ſo juſt an occaſion offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from the Text, give me leave to ſpeak to them ſeverally. Begin with the former.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Suffering in Soul.</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Thus did our bleſſed <hi>Saviour</hi> ſuffer,
<note place="margin">Suffering in Soul.</note> not only in the <hi>outward man,</hi> but alſo in the <hi>inward,</hi> not only in his <hi>Body,</hi> but in his <hi>Soul.

And what could it be that ſhould thus affect his Body, but the anguiſh of his ſoul then conflicting with the apprehenſion of that wrath which he was now to feele, the wrath of God due unto ſinners, in whoſe room he was now to ſtand as a ſurety and Redeemer? Thus were theſe <hi>waters even come into his ſoul</hi> (as <hi>David</hi> in a different ſenſe ſpeaks it of himſelf, Pſal. 69.1.)

<pb n="236" facs="tcp:170444:123"/>the apprehenſion of thoſe Corporall puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which he was to ſuffer. This were a thing very diſhonourable to imagine, that whereas ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the <hi>Martyrs</hi> have gone triumphing to the ſtake or gibbet, going ſinging to the induring of far greater torments, more cruell deaths then this was, that he who was their <hi>Leader,</hi> the <hi>Captain of their ſalvation,</hi> ſhould fall ſo far below them in reſolution and courage, as thus to tremble at the thought of his Croſſe. Surely there was ſomewhat more in this <hi>Cup,</hi> which made it ſo bitter to him. <hi>And what ſhould that be, But his ſuffering in ſoul?</hi> And yet ſee how, having recollected his ſpirits, he here ſubmitteth to the drinking of this <hi>Cup,</hi> the ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring whatever his Father ſhould pleaſe to inflict upon him. <hi>The Cup which my Father hath given me ſhall I not drink it?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus are Gods Children to ſubmit to the will of their heavenly Father, if he ſhall call them to the taſting of this Cup.

Whileſt they wait for their God, he <hi>waiteth that he may be gratious</hi> unto them, (as the former part of that verſe hath it,) only expecting a ſeaſonable time to ſhew himſelf unto them in a way of mercy. And therefore (to cloſe up this Direction,) however the Lord pleaſe to deal with us, though he ſeeme to withdraw himſelf from us, yet with patience wait for him, by faith reſting upon the word of promiſe, ſtaying our ſouls upon him. That is the advice which the ſame Prophet holdeth forth in that obvious, but excellent Text, Iſai. 50.10. <hi>Who is among you that feareth the Lord, that obeyeth the voice of his ſervant, that walketh in darkneſſe, and hath no light, let him truſt in the name of the Lord, and stay himſelf upon his God.</hi> And this let the Lords people doe, ſuch as unfeignedly fear God, yeilding obedience to his

<note place="margin">Yet by grace.</note>
            </p>
            <p>But to <hi>Grace</hi> this is poſſible. <hi>This being one of thoſe ends wherefore Chriſt dyed, that through death he might deliver them who through fear of death were all their life time ſubject unto bondage</hi> (as the Apoſtle tels us,) <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.15. Such is the condition of all the Sons of men by nature, being continually ſubject unto death, they are in bondage through the fear of it. But this priviledge Chriſt hath by his death obtained for his Elect, that through grace, through faith in him, they may be freed and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from this bondage, this fear. Though not from the <hi>Naturall,</hi> yet from the <hi>ſlaviſh fear</hi> of it. As for the <hi>Naturall fear of it,</hi> that our bleſſed Saviour himſelf was not free from, noe more are the beſt of Saints. Not thus to fear death what is it but <hi>Hominem exuere,</hi> to put off humanity? But for the <hi>ſervile,</hi> ſlaviſh fear of it, that through grace believers may be freed from. Yea ſo freed from it, as to receive, and embrace death, <hi>readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and willingly.</hi> This we find ſome of the Saints to have done. <hi>Lord now letteſt thou thy Servant de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part in peace</hi> (ſaith old <hi>Simeon</hi>) Luk. 2.29. <hi>I deſire to be diſſolved, and to be with Chriſt</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul</hi>) Phil. 1.23. <hi>In this we groan deſiring earneſtly to be cloathed

He found not only no delight and contentment in his condition, but a great deal of trouble and miſery, which made him even weary of his life, And the like troubles, in ſome kind or other are all men here ſubject to. <hi>Man is born to trouble as the ſparks flye upward</hi> (ſaith <hi>Eliphaz</hi>) Job. 5.7. <hi>Man that is born of a woman is of few dayes, and full of trouble</hi> (ſaith <hi>Job</hi>) Job. 14.1. <hi>Few and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill have the dayes of the years of my life been</hi> (ſaith the Patriarch <hi>Jacob</hi>) Gen. 47.9. <hi>Few</hi> in compariſon with many of his fore-fathers, and <hi>evill</hi> in regard of the manifold croſſes which he met with.

            <p n="1">1. In the Firſt place,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
               <note place="margin">Look upon God, who hath appointed and determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</note>

               <hi>It is appointed to men once to die,</hi> Heb. 9.27. Appointed, <hi>viz.</hi>

Which Law alſo he <hi>executeth</hi> upon parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular perſons, bringing them to death. <hi>I know that thou wilt bring me to death, and to the houſe appointed for all living,</hi> Job 30 23.

<note place="margin">The time, when.</note>

So certain are Gods decrees concerning the time of mans life, that he cannot go beyond the term limited; the Year, the Moneth, the Day, the Hour ſet down. <hi>Father the hour is come,</hi> (ſaith our Saviour, ſpeaking of the time appointed for his ſuffering of death) Joh. 17.1.</p>

And ſo is it determined concerning eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the ſons of men, as when and where, ſo how they ſhall dye. None of theſe are left to Chance and Fortune. Time, place, manner, all appointed by God. Which being ſeriouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered and believed, it will be of great uſe to bring the heart to a quiet and willing ſubmiſſion to the will of God in ſuffering what he hath ſo appointed. Thus look at <hi>God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Second place look we upon <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi>

So the next verſe explaines it. <hi>For that righteous man dwelling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, in ſeeing and hearing vexed his Soul from day to day with their unlawfull deeds.</hi> To ſee God ſo highly diſhoured, his Lawes ſo ſhamefully viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as by all kinds of abhominations they were, this was a continuall corraſive, and heart-brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king unto him. And ſo was it to <hi>David,</hi> who was in like manner affected with the ſins of the times wherein he lived, as he ſets it forth, Pſal. 119. v. 136. <hi>Rivers of waters run down mine eys becauſe they keep not thy Law.</hi> And again, verſe 158. <hi>I beheld the tranſgreſsours, and was grieved, becauſe they kept not thy word.</hi> And it cannot be otherwiſe with a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious ſpirit, to ſee the Abhominations of the times and places wherein he liveth, to hear the name of his God blaſphemed, to ſee his Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces profaned, his worſhip ſleighted, his meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers ſcorned, his truths affronted, his waies evil ſpoken of, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> this cannot but affect it. This it was that made <hi>David</hi> crye out in his Baniſhment as he doth, Pſal. 120.5. <hi>Woe is me that I ſojourn in Meſheck, that I dwell in the tents of Kedar,</hi> that is, amongſt a ſavage and barbarous people, who had no knowledge, nor fear of God, whoſe lives and converſations were wicked and abominable. And truly ſuch is this world in a great meaſure, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a Chriſtian ſhall meet with two many of this rank. The conſideration whereof ſhould make
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:170444:140"/>him the more willing to leave it, to embrace Death when it cometh; which is Gods <hi>Fan,</hi> whereby he ſevereth his <hi>Wheat</hi> from the Worlds <hi>Chaffe,</hi> the <hi>precious</hi> from the <hi>vile,</hi> his own peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from others, ſo as they ſhall no longer be in danger of being ſeduced by evill doers, or yet be infeſted by them. The <hi>Goats</hi> being ſeparated from the <hi>Sheep,</hi> they ſhall be no longer an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noyance to them, as here by the ſtinch of their unclean and filthy converſation they were. In that <hi>New Jeruſalem,</hi> into which Death letteth all true Believers, <hi>there ſhall in no wiſe enter any thing that defileth, neither whatever worketh abomination,</hi> Rev. 21. laſt. Thus doth Death free them from this worſt of Evils, <hi>ſin,</hi> both from the <hi>committing,</hi> and <hi>inbeing,</hi> and <hi>beholding</hi> of it.</p>

               <hi>In that he dyed, he dyed unto ſin once.</hi> Rom. 6.10. This he did not for <hi>himſelf,</hi> (for he <hi>knew no ſin</hi>) but <hi>for us,</hi> for the expiating of our ſins, the taking away the <hi>guilt</hi> of them. And what he did once, doe we <hi>daily, daily</hi> dye to
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:170444:151"/>ſin for the taking away the power of it in our ſelves. A work which will not be done at once, (as that of our Saviour was.) True, the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſpeaking of believers, ſaith, they are <hi>dead to ſin,</hi> Rom. 6.2.11. in as much as they are not now under the power of it, as ſometimes they were. But this is but an imperfect work, not done at once. Though ſin hath received its mortal wound in them, yet it is ſtil alive. Though they be dead to it, yet it <hi>liveth in them.</hi> And therefore they muſt make this their daily, their continual work, to be dying to it, <hi>mortifying the body of ſin,</hi> that it may dye before them. <hi>The life of ſin is the life of death.</hi> So long as a man liveth in any one ſin, he will never be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to dye. And therefore ſet we upon the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification of all our ſinful Luſts. <hi>Specially our belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Luſts,</hi> thoſe which have been moſt near and dear to us, moſt ſtrong and prevalent in us.

Thus Sin being dead, death will not be ſo terrible. As we get ground of the one, we ſhal get ſtrength againſt the other.</p>

He had as little affection to the world as the world had to him, he was dead to that, and that to him. And it is the counſel which he giveth to others, 1 Cor. 7.31. that they <hi>ſhould ſo uſe this world, as not abuſing it.</hi> Not doting upon any thing here below, whether riches, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Not being inordinately affected with any contentments which this world can afford, but looking overly upon them, ſo uſing them as if they uſed them not. So run thoſe fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going directions of the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> there, 1 Cor. 7.29, 30. <hi>This I ſay brethren, the time is ſhort, It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth that both they that have wives be as though they had none, and they that weep, as though they wept not, and they that rejoyce as though they rejoyced not, and they that buy as though they poſſeſſed not.</hi> And this let every of us ſtrive to do, to bring and keep our hearts in ſuch a temper as that we may not be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinately affected with any thing here below, whether <hi>Croſſes</hi> or <hi>Comforts.</hi> Not but that a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian may be affected with both. He may both <hi>Weep,</hi> and <hi>Rejoyce,</hi> and that upon the account of temporal concernments. But ſee that it be not in an inordinate manner. And ſo may he buy and ſell, ſeek and indeavour to get an eſtate in the world, to purchaſe and poſſeſs houſes and lands. But take we heed we do not make them our chief poſſeſſion. It is a good diſtinction, which <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine maketh</hi> uſe of, betwixt <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ti</hi> and <hi>Frui, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſing</hi> and <hi>injoying.</hi> Which let all of us learn, that ſo we may not be guilty of what he chargeth as a great impiety, viz. <hi>

<pb n="295" facs="tcp:170444:152"/>we uſed them not. Thus labour we ſo take of our hearts, that they may ſit looſe to the world. Which till a man do, he will never be willing to leave it. Surely this is it which maketh the men of this world ſo unwilling to hear of death, much more to ſee it, their hearts are glewed and faſtned to the world, to the profits, or pleaſures, or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of it; Some thing or other there is to which they are wedded. And no wonder then that this <hi>Apparatour, Death,</hi> which brings to them a <hi>Bil of divorce,</hi> ſhould be ſo unwelcome a meſſenger. Get we our hearts then weaned and taken of from all theſe, ſo as we may leave this world before it leaveth us, leave it in <hi>Affection</hi> before we leave it in <hi>Perſon.</hi> Which having done death will not be unwelcome.</p>
